    In this experiment you are required to say the color of the word, not what
    the word says.  For example, for the word, <font
    color="#0000cc"><strong>CHIPS</strong></font>, you should say "Blue."<p>
    
    As soon as the words appear on your screen, read the list as fast as you
    can.  When you have finished, click on the "Finish" button.  The time it
    took you to read all of the words will be shown.  If you want to try the
    same set of words, back to this webpage and do the test again.<p>
